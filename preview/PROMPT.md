/i -s Telegram sticker design: the bold text "BLP" dominates the center on a torn, blood-stained banner, carved like cracked metal glowing faintly from within. Behind it, a fierce pirate skull with both thumbs up in a tattered tricorn hat, framed by cracked ship wheels and frayed ropes. White skull with deep shadows, broken teeth, and glowing eyes with smoke. Accents: crimson red, muted cyan, steel blue, metallic gold. Dark, high-contrast Warcraft-style shading, cursed pirate energy. Black background with thick white outline, iconic sticker look.
